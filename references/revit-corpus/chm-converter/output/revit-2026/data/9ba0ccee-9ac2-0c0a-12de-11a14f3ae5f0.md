[ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm)|  When setting this property: The given value for baseElevation must be no more than 30000 feet in absolute value. -or- When setting this property: The baseElevation doesn't meet the restriction that bottom of run should not be lower than bottom of stairs. -or- When setting this property: The baseElevation doesn't meet the minimal height restriction of the stairs run. -or- When setting this property: The baseElevation impacts the top elevation which is less than extension below base.   
The base elevation has following restrictions: 
  * The base elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs to which the stairs run belongs.
  * When setting this property the value will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.
  * When setting this property for common run, the run's height will change according to the new base/top elevation. So the value must be less than the top elevation to keep run valid.
  * When setting this property for sketched run, whose height is fixed, the run's top elevation will be adjusted to keep the same run height.
