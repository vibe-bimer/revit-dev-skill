#### Parameters
accountId Guid
     The BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs account Id. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id: 
  * If you get the hub Id with Forge Data Management API, remove the prefix "b." of the Id string and convert the rest to a Guid. 
  * If you get the account Id with Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API, just convert the Id string to a Guid. 

projectId Guid
     The BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs project Id. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id: 
  * If you get the project Id with Forge Data Management API, remove the prefix "b." of the Id string and convert the rest to a Guid. 
  * If you get the project Id with Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API, just convert the Id string to a Guid. 

folderId String
     Folder identity in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs to save the model. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id: 
  * The folder Id string from Forge Data Management API. 
  * The folder Id string from Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API. 

modelName String
     Model name in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs to save the model.

Assumes that user is currently signed in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs and has access to Autodesk cloud services. This operation will create a model on cloud and then create a local cache of the cloud model. This method cannot be used when current document is already in cloud. 
You can use one of the following methods to save a local model as a workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs. 
  * If the local model is a workshared model, then it will be a workshared cloud model after you use this method successfully. 
  * If the local model is a non-workshared model, you can enable the workset with [EnableWorksharing(String, String)](7c29717e-1d8c-4e02-20ad-65c53ea8eaaa.htm) and then save as a workshared cloud model. 
  * If the local model is a non-workshared model, and you have already saved it as a non-workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs, you can still enable the workset with [EnableCloudWorksharing](4146e816-565e-85d8-ce94-93ec505a0924.htm) to convert it to a workshared cloud model. 

You cannot save a local workshared model as a non-workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs.
