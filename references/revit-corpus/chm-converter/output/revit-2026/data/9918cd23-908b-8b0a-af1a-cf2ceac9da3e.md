# IModelExportContext Methods

---  
The [IModelExportContext](4309af43-f04e-4e42-2539-3fd1d64cdc6d.htm) type exposes the following members.
| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
![Public method](../icons/pubMethod.gif)| [OnCurve](6306ac1d-c259-5617-f71b-c13e54e5af0d.htm)|  This method is called when a Curve is being output. (Inherited from [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.htm))  
![Public method](../icons/pubMethod.gif)| [OnLineSegment](5fe0cee4-825b-9828-2c45-5e4c5019bc37.htm)|  This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to line segments and sent to the output. Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style, then 
  * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls
  * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline
